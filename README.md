Data leakage is a common problem in machine learning that can have serious consequences for the reliability and validity of your models. At its core, data leakage refers to situations where information from the test set "leaks" into the training set, causing your model to learn relationships that are not truly representative of the underlying data.

Data leakage can take many forms and can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect feature engineering, improper cross-validation, and flawed experimental design
